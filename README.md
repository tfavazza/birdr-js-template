[BirdR](https://tfavazza.github.io/birdr-js-template) - A twitter clone of only
emojis!

Ruby on Rails backend is [here](https://github.com/tfavazza/birdr-api-template)

BirdR is a simplified Twitter-like app that allows a user to post 14-emoji-long
messages (chirps), view their own chirps, and view the chirps of every user. It
uses regex to delete any non-emoji character from the input box. Styles are
mostly from Bootstrap, and chirps are formatted using Handlebars.

Future versions will include Friend Lists and the ability to delete chirps. Time
constraints for the project's due date forced these features to be cut.

User stories and wireframes are posted [here](http://imgur.com/a/TnikA).
